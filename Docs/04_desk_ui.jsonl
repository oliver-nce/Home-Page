As the name suggests, these reports are built\nusing Python scripts. Since these reports give you unrestricted access via\nPython scripts, they can only be created by Administrators. These reports are\nmeant to be written during development and be a part of your app.\n\n> To create Script Reports you must enable Developer Mode.\n\nTo create a Script Report, type \"new report\" in the awesomebar and hit enter.\n\n1. Set Report Type as \"Script Report\"\n2. Set \"Is Standard\" as \"Yes\"\n3. Select the Module in which you want to add this report\n4. In the module folder (for example if it is Accounts in ERPnext the folder\n   will be `erpnext/accounts/report/[report-name]`) you will see that templates\n   for the report files will be created.\n5.

Here you can set the label, width, format (fieldtype) for the columns and filters.\n\nFilters can be used as formatting variables in the query. For example a filters of type `customer` can be used as `%(customer)s` in the query.\n\n![Standard Columns and Filters](/files/report-columns-filters.png)\n\n### Custom Report\n\nIn custom reports, you can use the [Script API](/framework/v14/user/en/desk/scripting/script-api) and write the script directly in the Code section.\n\n```python\nreturn frappe.db.get_all('User', ['first_name', 'last_name'], filters = filters)\n```", "content_type": "mixed", "has_code": true, "token_count": 523}
